# Object_Grid_Motion_Detection_using_DL_CV
In this code, we developed a object detection using Deep Learning model with help of openCV computer vision. 

To run this project on any deep learning object detection model such as (YOLOv3, YOLOv4, YOLOv5, YOLOv6, YOLOv7, YOLOv8)
1. Download the weights of the YOLO, for this project we used YOLOv3 you can download the weights of YOLOv3 from here: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
2. After downloading weights, adjust the path directories of CFG and COCO.name files according to your folder path directory.
3. Run the program file main1.py! and enjoy the object grid motion detection using Computer Vision and Deep Learning.
